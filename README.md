# Web3 Ad Platform - FlashAd

> **EthOnline 2025 Hackathon Project**

## What We're Building

A blockchain-based advertising platform that brings **Web3 transparency and decentralization with Web2 speed and user experience**.

### The Problem
Traditional ad platforms lack transparency, have high fees, and centralized control. Existing Web3 solutions are too slow and require wallet interactions that create friction for end users.

### Our Solution
FlashAd combines the best of both worlds:

- **For Advertisers**: Create CPM/CPC campaigns with transparent blockchain payments and real-time analytics
- **For Publishers**: Monetize websites instantly with a single script tag integration
- **For Viewers**: Zero friction ad experience - no wallet required, sub-200ms load times

### Key Innovation

**Hybrid Architecture** that delivers Web3 benefits without Web3 friction:

1. **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized ad content storage
2. **CDN Caching**: Lightning-fast delivery via Cloudflare
3. **Off-chain Processing**: Impressions logged to database for speed
4. **Batch Settlement**: Periodic blockchain updates for efficiency
5. **Instant Withdrawals**: Publishers get paid without waiting for blockchain confirmation

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Hardhat)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Storage**: IPFS + CDN
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (testnet for hackathon)
